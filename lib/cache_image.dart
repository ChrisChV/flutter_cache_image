  /// -1.0) aligns the image to the top-left corner of its layout bounds, while an

  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and
  /// [Canvas.drawImageRect].
  ///
  /// If the [alignment] is [TextDirection]-dependent (i.e. if it is a
  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then an ambient [Directionality] widget
  /// must be in scope.
  ///
  /// Defaults to [Alignment.center].
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [Alignment], a class with convenient constants typically used to

  ///    relative to text direction.

  /// only horizontally and the region of the image to the left and right of
  /// the center slice will be stretched only vertically.

  /// a scaling factor of -1 in the horizontal direction so that the origin is
  /// in the top right.
  ///
  /// This is occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for
  /// images that were designed for left-to-right locales. Be careful, when
  /// using this, to not flip images with integral shadows, text, or other
